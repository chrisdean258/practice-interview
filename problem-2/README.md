# Problem 2

In `stats.c` please implement `size_t max_minus_min(char * lines[128])` and
`size_t count_max_4(char * lines[128])`.

`size_t max_minus_min(char * lines[128])` should calculate count of the maximum
occurring character in any of the strings string and the minimum count of any
occuring character in any of the strings and return their difference.

`size_t count_max_4(char * lines[128])` should return the maximum count of any
sequence of four characters across all of the lines.

This code is processing DNA sequences encoded as characters and is not required
to be a general solution to these problems for non DNA sequences.
